According to the bar chart, Florida is the state with the highest quantity of beer purchased.A company may use this knowledge to allocate more inventory to warehouses in Florida/tailor their marketing efforts to those in Florida.\nNext, we want to see the most popular beer brands in the U.S. across all states by their quantity\n\nstate_brand_total &lt;- beer_markets|&gt;\n  group_by(state, brand) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_quantity))\n\n# Calculate total beer consumption by brand across all states (national level)\nnational_brand_total &lt;- state_brand_total |&gt;\n  group_by(brand) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_quantity_national = sum(total_quantity)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_quantity_national))\n\nggplot(national_brand_total, aes(x = reorder(brand, total_quantity_national), y = total_quantity_national)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"yellow\") +\n  labs(title = \"National Total Quantity by Brand\",\n       x = \"Brand\",\n       y = \"Total Quantity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the top 5 brands that yield the most demand across all states. As we can see, Bud Light is the beer brand in this data set with the highest quantity purchased across all the states.\nAdditionally, the state_brand_total data frame shows us the top beer companies in the top 5 states provided earlier. The results are Florida: Natural Light Texas: Natural Light California: Bud Light Ohio: Miller lite North Carolina: Bud Light\nThis will tell a company interested in entering those specific states who their top competitors will be.\n#Promo and Brand This is going to show if the companies selling beer are actually promoting what they are selling\n\npromotion &lt;- beer_markets |&gt; \n  group_by(brand) |&gt; \n  summarise(total_promo = sum(promo))\n\nggplot(promotion, aes(x = brand, y = total_promo)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"Identity\", fill = \"Black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Beer Promo per Company\",\n       x = \"Brand\",\n       y = \"Total Promotion\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n#Signifcance\nThrough being able to identify how much people are spending on alcohol and how much they are buying and what their living conditions it could be used to help them and maybe help them realize how much they are truly spending. We can also identify what households are buying a lot of alcohol, this is important as alcohol can lead to abuse to other people in the household, by keeping track of who is buying what and marking high buyers.\n##References\n\nbeer_markets &lt;- read_csv(\"https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets_all.csv\")"

According to the bar chart, Florida is the state with the highest quantity of beer purchased.A company may use this knowledge to allocate more inventory to warehouses in Florida/tailor their marketing efforts to those in Florida.\nNext, we want to see the most popular beer brands in the U.S. across all states by their quantity\n\nstate_brand_total &lt;- beer_markets|&gt;\n  group_by(state, brand) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_quantity = sum(quantity)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_quantity))\n\n# Calculate total beer consumption by brand across all states (national level)\nnational_brand_total &lt;- state_brand_total |&gt;\n  group_by(brand) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_quantity_national = sum(total_quantity)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_quantity_national))\n\nggplot(national_brand_total, aes(x = reorder(brand, total_quantity_national), y = total_quantity_national)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"yellow\") +\n  labs(title = \"National Total Quantity by Brand\",\n       x = \"Brand\",\n       y = \"Total Quantity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows the top 5 brands that yield the most demand across all states. As we can see, Bud Light is the beer brand in this data set with the highest quantity purchased across all the states.\nAdditionally, the state_brand_total data frame shows us the top beer companies in the top 5 states provided earlier. The results are Florida: Natural Light Texas: Natural Light California: Bud Light Ohio: Miller lite North Carolina: Bud Light\nThis will tell a company interested in entering those specific states who their top competitors will be.\n#Promo and Brand This is going to show if the companies selling beer are actually promoting what they are selling\n\npromotion &lt;- beer_markets |&gt; \n  group_by(brand) |&gt; \n  summarise(total_promo = sum(promo))\n\nggplot(promotion, aes(x = brand, y = total_promo)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"Identity\", fill = \"Black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Total Beer Promo per Company\",\n       x = \"Brand\",\n       y = \"Total Promotion\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n#Signifcance\nThrough being able to identify how much people are spending on alcohol and how much they are buying and what their living conditions it could be used to help them and maybe help them realize how much they are truly spending. We can also identify what households are buying a lot of alcohol, this is important as alcohol can lead to abuse to other people in the household, by keeping track of who is buying what and marking high buyers.\n##References\n\nbeer_markets &lt;- read_csv(\"https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets_all.csv\")"
