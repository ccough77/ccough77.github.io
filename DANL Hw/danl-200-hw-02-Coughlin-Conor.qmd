</p>



Below is the data.frame `holiday_movies` containing information about holiday & Christmas movies (Source: [the Internet Movie Database (IMDb)](https://www.imdb.com/)). 

```{r}
pathname <- "https://bcdanl.github.io/data/holiday_movies_w_genres.csv"
holiday_movies <- read_csv(pathname)
```

```{r}
rmarkdown::paged_table(holiday_movies)
```

## Variable Description

- `tconst`: alphanumeric unique identifier of the title

- `title_type`: the type/format of the title 

- `title`: the more popular title / the title used by the filmmakers on promotional materials at the point of release

- `genre`: genre associated with the title

- `year`: the release year of a title

- `runtime_minutes`: primary runtime of the title, in minutes

- `average_rating`: weighted average of all the individual user ratings on IMDb

- `num_votes`: number of votes the title has received on IMDb



<br>

## Question 1.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the relationship between `log10(num_votes)` and `average_rating` varies by `genre`.

*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = num_votes, y = average_rating))
# The average rating and the log of the number of votes varies on genre because it can still have a good rating but very low votes which is common with different genres
```

<br><br>

## Question 2.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `genre` varies by `title_type`.


*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = genres, y = title_type))
# Genre and title_type have a different distribution as with different genres the titles will reflect it as to show what people would see in it and how it is portrayed
```


<br><br>


## Question 3.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `average_rating`, such as quartile values and outliers, varies by `genre` and `title_type`.


*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = genre, y = title_type))
#The average rating has changed depending on the genre and the title type, seeming that people prefer different genres for different style of movies/TV
```


<br><br>


## Question 4.
Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the distribution of `log(num_votes)` varies by `genre`.

*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = num_votes, y = genre))
#Genre affects the number of votes but it is also dependent on the year and how well the movie is perceived, though it depends on the genre and how well people receive it 
```


<br><br>


## Question 5.
Below is the data.frame, `holiday_movies_genre_yearly`, containing yearly mean value of `average_rating` for each `genre`.

```{r}
holiday_movies_genre_yearly <- read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/holiday_movies_w_genres_yearly.csv")
```

Provide both (1) `ggplot` code and (2) a comment to describe how the yearly trend of `average_rating` varies by `genre`.



*Answer*:
```{r}
ggplot(data = holiday_movies_genre_yearly) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = average_rating, y = genre))
# The yearly trend of average rating by genre shows what people believe and what the popular genre was and what the unpopular genres were for that year
```



<br><br>



## Question 6.
Provide your GitHub username, if you have not provided it in Homework 1.

  - Describe yourself in `index.qmd`.
  - Add the picture file (e.g., `png`) of your profile photo to `img` directory. Then correct `img/profile.png` in `index.qmd` accordingly.
  - Add the PDF file of your resumé to the website working directory in your laptop (or Posit Cloud).
  - Correct links for your resumé, LinkedIn, email, and optionally social media.
  - Make sure that you do not have any broken links in your website.
